InvisibleRoutes
===============

Calculate preferred routes to a destination using Google API directions service


----

This simulation evaluates the preferred routes to reach the destination at the center of the map.
The main goal of this project is to give a powerful tool for urban and territorial analysis,
to be used in all those locations of the world where Google Directions are available.
We believe that strong ideas have to be combined with a simple interface and open available data.
